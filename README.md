💻 My Dev Setup:
- I daily-drive [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org)
- [My server](https://www.qct.io/product/index/Server/rackmount-server/1U-Rackmount-Server/QuantaGrid-D51B-1U) also runs Debian 12 with a bunch of [Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com/) under my bed 😅
- I mainly use [VSCode]([https://code.visualstudio.com/]), but you may find me using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) as well
